Simulated 2000W DC buck converter with ATmega328P-based control, protection circuitry, and EasyEDA schematic.
# 2000W DC Load Controller | Buck Converter + ATmega328P

## 🧠 Overview
This project simulates a 2000W load controller using a buck converter topology. Designed using EasyEDA, it includes control logic based on the ATmega328P microcontroller and safety features like overvoltage and short-circuit protection.

## 🔧 Project Scope
- Fully simulated in EasyEDA (schematic only)
- Power regulation via DC-DC buck converter
- Fault protection mechanisms included (TVS diode, capacitor bank)
- Microcontroller (ATmega328P) used for PWM-based switching (planned, not implemented)
